# SQL Codewars Challenges

## About Codewars

[Codewars](http://codewars.com/) is a site built by developers at a hack-a-thon, that can be very useful in exposing you to varied exercises across different languages and techniques for solving them. It's a great resource for preparing you for the same kinds of questions you will be asked to solve during technical interviews. Codewars provides built-in testing, solutions, and rankings for developers looking to get reps in and "level up". It is a great resource for staying on top of your current skills and learning new ones as you grow as a developer.

## Ranking system

Codewars ranks the level of how hard each challenge ("kata") is by a scale of "kyu" that goes from 8 - 1 where 8 is the easiest. One of the nice features of Codewars is that you can see other solutions including solutions that the community rated as the best. Once you have submitted a working solution, you'll have the ability to look at other solutions to learn alternate ways of solving problems that you might not have thought about before. 

## Your turn!
